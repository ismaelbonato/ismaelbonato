# 👋 Hi there! I'm Ismael Bonato

🤖 As a software developer with over 11 years of experience, I have designed, developed, and optimized software for embedded systems across various industries, including access control, IoT, and TV boxes. I'm specialized in C/C++, Yocto, and Qt framework, with hands-on experience in micro-controller programming, device drivers, and firmware development. I am also passionate about free software and technology, and more recently studying Neural Networks as a new passion.
